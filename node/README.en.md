# JumpServer PAM Node.js SDK

Fetch the target account with `account_id`. Apply and verify the application change, then report `success` or `failed` using `event_id`. A delivery receipt or successful fetch does not mean the application succeeded. Events and reconnect snapshot items include `event_id`, `account_id` and `account_revision`. Verify the account version before applying it. Restart and manual switch commands must first be claimed with `running`. Make application handlers idempotent; a reconnect may repeat an event.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.3+ / ws
- `demo.js`

## Configure and run

Install the source SDK and use the configuration below. Authorize accounts for pull in Application Management; bind policies only when push or rotation is needed. Obtain the application AK/SK and organization ID from its access materials. Replace placeholders and keep identity material in deployment secrets. Use a stable, unique instance ID for each replica. Fetch with exactly one selector: account ID or policy key.

```bash
cd node
export JMS_ENDPOINT='https://jumpserver.example.com'
export JMS_APP_ID='<app-id>'
export JMS_APP_SECRET='<app-secret>'
export JMS_ORG_ID='<org-id>'
export JMS_INSTANCE_ID='app-node-1'
export JMS_ACCOUNT_ID='<account-id>'

npm ci
node demo.js
```

The SDK packages are currently installed from this repository; they are not published to public package registries. Replace /path/to/jumpserver with an absolute path. Run the Go and Node.js install commands in your application directory, or add the Java dependency to your application pom.xml. Local imports in the runnable repository examples should be replaced by the package imports below.

```bash
npm install /path/to/pam-clients/node
```

```javascript
const { Client } = require('@jumpserver/pam')
// ESM: import { Client } from '@jumpserver/pam'
```

## Request and response

```javascript
'use strict'

const { Client } = require('./index')

async function main() {
  const client = new Client({
    endpoint: process.env.JMS_ENDPOINT,
    appId: process.env.JMS_APP_ID,
    appSecret: process.env.JMS_APP_SECRET,
    instanceId: process.env.JMS_INSTANCE_ID,
    orgId: process.env.JMS_ORG_ID,
  })
  try {
    const account = await client.getAccount({ accountId: process.env.JMS_ACCOUNT_ID })
    // Pass account.username / secret to the application connection pool.
    console.log(
      `Fetched revision ${account.revision}; implement application credential switching.`,
    )
  } finally {
    client.close()
  }
}

if (require.main === module)
  main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error.code || error.name)
    process.exitCode = 1
  })
```

## Events and credential application

Fetch the target account with `account_id`. Apply and verify the application change, then report `success` or `failed` using `event_id`. A delivery receipt or successful fetch does not mean the application succeeded. Events and reconnect snapshot items include `event_id`, `account_id` and `account_revision`. Verify the account version before applying it. Restart and manual switch commands must first be claimed with `running`. Make application handlers idempotent; a reconnect may repeat an event.

```javascript
'use strict'
const { Client } = require('./index')

async function applyAccount(account) {
  // Validate a new connection, switch the pool, then release old connections.
  throw new Error('Implement application account switching')
}
async function applyEvent(client, event) {
  if (event.event === 'application.restart.requested')
    throw new Error('Implement application restart and health check')
  const account = await client.getAccount({ accountId: event.accountId, allowLocalFallback: false })
  if (account.revision !== event.accountRevision) throw new Error('Event account version is superseded')
  await applyAccount(account)
}
async function handleEvent(client, event) {
  if (event.commandId) {
    const claim = await client.reportApplicationCommandResult({ commandId: event.commandId, status: 'running' })
    if (!claim.accepted) return
  }
  try { await applyEvent(client, event) }
  catch (error) {
    await client.confirmEvent({ eventId: event.eventId, status: 'failed', errorCode: 'application_failed' })
    throw error
  }
  await client.confirmEvent({ eventId: event.eventId })
}
async function main() {
  const client = new Client({ endpoint: process.env.JMS_ENDPOINT, appId: process.env.JMS_APP_ID,
    appSecret: process.env.JMS_APP_SECRET, instanceId: process.env.JMS_INSTANCE_ID, orgId: process.env.JMS_ORG_ID })
  const stop = () => client.close()
  process.once('SIGINT', stop); process.once('SIGTERM', stop)
  try {
    for await (const event of client.watchCredentialEvents()) {
      const updates = event.commandId || event.event === 'credential.updated' ? [event]
        : event.event === 'snapshot' ? event.credentials || [] : []
      // Reconcile removed connections on snapshots; release revoked accounts.
      for (const update of updates) {
        try { await handleEvent(client, update) }
        catch (error) { console.error(error.code || error.name) }
      }
    }
  } finally { await client.close(); process.off('SIGINT', stop); process.off('SIGTERM', stop) }
}
if (require.main === module) main().catch((error) => { console.error(error.code || error.name); process.exitCode = 1 })
```

`get_credential` and key-based confirmation remain available for older integrations. New integrations use `get_account` and `confirm_event`. The event-result workflow requires the corresponding Core update; SDK 1.0.2 alone cannot add this server capability.

## Application commands

Fetch the target account with `account_id`. Apply and verify the application change, then report `success` or `failed` using `event_id`. A delivery receipt or successful fetch does not mean the application succeeded. Events and reconnect snapshot items include `event_id`, `account_id` and `account_revision`. Verify the account version before applying it. Restart and manual switch commands must first be claimed with `running`. Make application handlers idempotent; a reconnect may repeat an event.

## Common methods

- `getAccount({accountId})`
- `getAccount({accountId, allowLocalFallback: false})`
- `confirmEvent({eventId, status, errorCode})`
- `watchCredentialEvents({signal})`
- `watchEvents({signal}) / startEvents({signal}) / stopEvents()`
- `EventSubscription.stop() / done`
- `listApplicationCommands()`
- `reportApplicationCommandResult({commandId, status, errorCode})`
- `executeApplicationCommand(event, handler)`
- `syncAgent({credentials, deliveredCredentials, ...})`
- `clone() / close()`

## Troubleshooting

HTTP, network, authentication and response decoding failures use the SDK exception/error type with code and HTTP status. Close streams and clients when finished. Clones have independent lifecycles. Retry transient failures at the application boundary and never log secrets or authentication headers.

`PAMError`

All SDKs use protocol version 1; Agent configuration uses schema version 1. A client_upgrade_required response (HTTP 426) requires checking compatibility and upgrading. Unknown optional fields and notification events are tolerated; unsupported policy modes must not be applied or confirmed. Received event receipts are sent automatically and do not prove credential application.

## Go Agent integration

Agent identity uses app_id, app_secret, org_id and a stable instance_id. Application authorization controls pull; policy bindings control push. All file paths and service actions are local: state_file retains the latest passwords, event_file appends metadata without secrets, delivery selects default output, and rules configure files, templates and reload/restart or fixed scripts. On an update notification the Agent fetches the current password, persists it, atomically replaces output files, then runs the configured action. Failed delivery is retried. Use credentials[].key from get_accounts in rules; subscription push keys are account:<account-id>, independent of the selecting policy. Empty rules write one file per key by default.

Local rules configure target files, JSON/EnvironmentFile rendering or trusted templates, and an optional systemd reload/restart or fixed executable. Scripts receive credential JSON on stdin, use fixed arguments, have a bounded timeout and must validate their application before returning success. Core cannot add script paths or expand local capabilities. Restart the Agent after editing its private configuration.

The downloaded bootstrap contains Agent identity and delivery settings. Edit rules to declare the account IDs used by the business, update its configuration, activate the change and verify the running connection. An account selector with allow_account_switch also follows A/B rotation in either direction. Optional credential_check validates the new login before file changes. The Agent supplies default state, event and socket paths and a 300-second reconciliation interval. Empty rules write one default file per delivered credential.
