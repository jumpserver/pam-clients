# JumpServer PAM Go SDK

<!-- sdk-doc:start -->

## 1. Prerequisites and workflow

1. Create an application and authorize the accounts it may retrieve.
2. Enable Account credential change notifications in the application when immediate updates are needed. This covers all authorized accounts. A/B switching uses a separate rotation policy.
3. Download the application access materials and protect its AK/SK. Give each replica a stable, unique instance ID.

Use only the retrieval section for pull-only access. For pushed updates or A/B rotation, implement the managed business callbacks and start listening. The SDK handles protocol and event results; the application validates and switches real connections. These examples reflect the current source: install a matching Core and SDK build before using new APIs; released 1.0.2 packages do not include all of them.

- Go 1.23+ / coder/websocket

## 2. Installation and identity

Install the SDK below and use the identity configuration downloaded from the application access wizard. Protect AK/SK and assign each replica a stable, unique instance ID.

Install the client source shipped by the same Core using the commands below; released v1.0.2 packages do not include managed callbacks. Replace jumpserver.example.com with your Core address. Keep the extracted jms-pam-clients directory with your application, including the Go module replacement path.

```bash
curl -fL https://jumpserver.example.com/api/v1/accounts/client-source/go/ -o jms-pam-clients.tar.gz &&
tar -xzf jms-pam-clients.tar.gz &&
go mod edit -replace github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go=./jms-pam-clients/go &&
go get github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go@v1.0.2
```

```go
import pam "github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go"
```

### Local source installation (alternative)

If this Core does not provide the source download endpoint, or for offline deployment, obtain its matching client source at `/path/to/pam-clients` and run the following from the application directory. Replace the path with your actual checkout.

```bash
go mod edit -replace=github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go=/path/to/pam-clients/go
go mod tidy
```


```bash
export JMS_ENDPOINT='https://jumpserver.example.com'
export JMS_APP_ID='<app-id>'
export JMS_APP_SECRET='<app-secret>'
export JMS_ORG_ID='<org-id>'
export JMS_INSTANCE_ID='app-node-1'
export JMS_ACCOUNT_ID='<account-id>'
```

## 3. Fetch the first account

`demo.go`

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	pam "github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go"
)

func main() {
	client, err := pam.NewClient(pam.Options{
		Endpoint:   os.Getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"),
		AppID:      os.Getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
		AppSecret:  os.Getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"),
		InstanceID: os.Getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"),
		OrgID:      os.Getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"),
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Invalid SDK configuration")
	}
	defer client.Close()
	account, err := client.GetAccount(context.Background(), os.Getenv("JMS_ACCOUNT_ID"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Credential fetch failed: %T", err)
	}
	// Pass account.Username / Secret to the application connection pool.
	fmt.Printf("Fetched revision %d; implement application credential switching.\n", account.Revision)
}
```

```bash
go run ./demo.go
```

## 4. Listen for updates and switch connections

Implement the account-change callback below, then start the managed listener. The SDK handles snapshots, fresh account lookup, account/version validation, retry, command claims and event results. Return only after validating the real connection, switching the application pool and releasing old connections. Python and Node.js use subclass hooks, Go uses OnAccountChanged, and Java uses AccountEventListener. The placeholder fails until business switching is implemented.

`events.go`

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	pam "github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go"
	"log"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"
)

func main() {
	client, err := pam.NewClient(pam.Options{
		Endpoint: os.Getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"), AppID: os.Getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
		AppSecret: os.Getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"), InstanceID: os.Getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"),
		OrgID: os.Getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"),
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Invalid SDK configuration")
	}
	defer client.Close()
	ctx, stop := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
	defer stop()
	// SDK handles snapshots, fresh fetches, versions, retries and event results.
	// Applied accounts are reported automatically. Pull-only code can call
	// client.ReportAccounts(ctx, []string{accountID}); an empty list clears usage.
	err = client.WatchEvents(ctx, pam.EventHandlers{
		OnAccountChanged: func(ctx context.Context, account pam.Account) error {
			// Validate, switch the connection pool and release old connections.
			// Return nil only after the application uses this account.
			return fmt.Errorf("implement application account switching")
		},
		OnAccountRevoked: func(ctx context.Context, accountID string) error {
			return fmt.Errorf("implement revoked account cleanup")
		},
	})
	if err != nil && !errors.Is(err, context.Canceled) {
		log.Printf("Event stream failed: %T", err)
	}
}
```

```bash
go run ./events.go
```

The account callback runs serially behind a bounded event queue. Failed account updates retry with 1–30 second backoff. Success is reported only after the business callback returns; a failed result upload retries the upload without repeating a completed action in the same listener. Commands execute only after an accepted claim; failed command actions are not automatically repeated. Applied accounts are reported as a complete usage snapshot; A/B switches replace the current account. Implement revoked-account cleanup for scope removals. Usage reporting, fetches and file delivery never themselves confirm application success. Low-level streams and legacy credential hooks retain explicit confirmation. Business handlers must remain idempotent across restarts.

### Lifecycle and shutdown

`WatchEvents(ctx, handlers)` / `StartEvents(ctx, handlers)`; `Stop()` / `Wait()`; `context.CancelFunc`

WatchEvents waits in the calling goroutine. StartEvents returns before initial synchronization is complete. One managed listener is allowed per client. Stop and Client.Close request cancellation; call Wait externally to join handlers. Do not call Wait from a handler, and make long operations honor the context.

### Latest credentials and backend outages

SDK credential getters request the API first. A successful fetch replaces the retained value without allowing revisions to move backwards. Only a timeout, network error or HTTP 5xx permits fallback to a previously fetched value for the same selector, marked as local; retained values have no time expiry. SDK caches are client-local memory: clones and restarts start empty. HTTP 401/403/404 or credential_not_found (HTTP 400) clear retained credentials and raise. HTTP 426 and malformed successful responses raise without using fallback; a missing optional metadata endpoint does not clear credentials. PAM Agent persists accounts declared by store/services in protected state; an undeclared on-demand query is not automatically retained. Explicit revocations take effect before HTTP refresh, including while offline. Push snapshots do not define the full authorization scope of stored accounts; successful reconciliation checks the current application authorization.

- `account.FromLocal`
- `GetAccountFresh(ctx, accountID)`

With managed event listening enabled, snapshot and credential.updated automatically fetch the current credential, replace the retained value and then invoke the business hook. A failed refresh leaves the previous value in place and retries. The PAM Agent also refetches on update notifications and retains its previous credentials during backend outages. Refresh and manual switching use the live-only calls below; a retained password must not be treated as a newly fetched revision or automatically confirmed.




## 5. Common methods

### List authorized accounts

Use the account listing methods to discover the application’s current authorized pull scope. Listings return account and asset metadata plus related push policies, without retrieving passwords or recording credential fetches. Accounts without policies are included. The full-list method follows all pages; the page method returns `count` and `accounts` (Go returns the slice and total separately). Defaults are limit 200 and offset 0; limit is 1–500 and search is at most 128 characters, matching account name, username, asset name or address. Duplicate accounts, incomplete results and changing totals raise an error; retry the whole listing if authorization changes. Use an account ID with the account-fetch method when its secret is needed. Examples require SDK source containing these new methods; published version 1.0.2 does not yet provide them in Python, Java or Node.js.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os"

	pam "github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go"
)

func main() {
	client, err := pam.NewClient(pam.Options{
		Endpoint: os.Getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"), AppID: os.Getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
		AppSecret: os.Getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"), InstanceID: os.Getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"),
		OrgID: os.Getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"),
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Invalid SDK configuration")
	}
	defer client.Close()
	ctx := context.Background()
	accounts, err := client.ListAccounts(ctx, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Account listing failed: %T", err)
	}
	for _, account := range accounts {
		fmt.Println(account.ID, account.Username, account.Asset.Name)
	}
	_, count, err := client.ListAccountsPage(ctx, 20, 0, "database")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Account page failed: %T", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Matching accounts:", count)
	// Use an authorized account.ID with GetAccount when its secret is needed.
}
```


### Application, replica and policy information

Read the authenticated application ID, name, organization and authorized account/policy counts with GetApplication; GetClientInfo returns only the current replica’s registration, type and versions. Policy listing returns the entire visible bound list, including disabled policies; search matches policy names or keys. Fetch a policy using exactly one of its ID or base policy key, rather than an account push key. Rotation policies require authorization for both accounts and the active account. Subscription counts include only accounts currently authorized to this application. These calls return metadata without secrets and do not fetch credentials or confirm application changes. As with account queries, the replica is registered on first access. They require updated Core and SDK source; the published 1.0.2 does not yet contain these methods.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	pam "github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/go"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	client, err := pam.NewClient(pam.Options{
		Endpoint: os.Getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"), AppID: os.Getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
		AppSecret: os.Getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"), InstanceID: os.Getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"),
		OrgID: os.Getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"),
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Invalid SDK configuration")
	}
	defer client.Close()
	ctx := context.Background()
	application, err := client.GetApplication(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Application query failed: %T", err)
	}
	fmt.Println(application.ID, application.Name, application.AccountsCount)
	replica, err := client.GetClientInfo(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Client query failed: %T", err)
	}
	fmt.Println(replica.InstanceID, replica.ClientVersion)
	policies, err := client.ListPolicies(ctx, "")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Policy listing failed: %T", err)
	}
	for _, policy := range policies {
		fmt.Println(policy.Key, policy.Name, policy.IsActive, policy.Status)
	}
	if len(policies) > 0 {
		policy, err := client.GetPolicy(ctx, pam.PolicySelector{PolicyID: policies[0].ID})
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Policy query failed: %T", err)
		}
		fmt.Println(policy.Name, policy.AccountsCount)
	}
}
```


### Application status reporting

Report a complete snapshot of the application state and the account IDs currently in use. States: `starting`, `running`, `degraded`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `error`. An empty account list clears previous usage. Call on state changes or from your own heartbeat; no background reporting is started. Python, Java and Node.js return false on network/API failures, including an older Core without this endpoint; Go provides `TryReportStatus` for the same behavior. Strict variants expose failure details. Invalid arguments are rejected. Requests use the configured HTTP timeout; keep reporting off latency-sensitive paths. Reporting never fetches secrets, confirms rotation or invalidates retained credentials. Use machine-readable `error_code` only, without secrets or exception messages. `get_client_info` / `GetClientInfo` / `getClientInfo` return the last reported snapshot and its timestamp.

```go
err := client.ReportAccounts(ctx, []string{account.ID})
// ReportAccounts(ctx, nil) clears the complete explicit usage snapshot.
// ReportStatus(ctx, report) also reports application health.
```


### API

- `GetApplication(ctx) / GetClientInfo(ctx)`
- `ReportAccounts(ctx, accountIDs) / TryReportStatus(ctx, ApplicationStatus{Status: ..., AccountIDs: ...}) / ReportStatus(ctx, report)`
- `ListPolicies(ctx, search) / GetPolicy(ctx, PolicySelector{Key: ...})`
- `ListAccounts(ctx, search)`
- `ListAccountsPage(ctx, limit, offset, search)`
- `GetAccount(ctx, accountID)`
- `GetAccountFresh(ctx, accountID)`
- `ConfirmEvent(ctx, eventID, status, errorCode)`
- `WatchEvents(ctx, EventHandlers{...}) / StartEvents(ctx, handlers)`
- `EventWatcher.Stop() / EventWatcher.Wait()`
- `WatchCredentialEvents(ctx, handler)`
- `ListApplicationCommands(ctx)`
- `ReportApplicationCommandResult(ctx, commandID, status, errorCode)`
- `ExecuteApplicationCommand(ctx, event, handler)`
- `SyncAgent(ctx, AgentSyncOptions{...})`
- `Clone() / Close()`

## 6. Verify the integration

1. Replace the account placeholder with an authorized account ID and verify a real connection without logging the password.
2. If listening for updates, verify initial synchronization and an authorized-account update or A/B switch; complete the business callback before expecting a successful event result.
3. Check the instance usage/status and event result separately. A fetch or usage report does not confirm credential application.

### Troubleshooting

HTTP, network, authentication and response decoding failures use the SDK exception/error type with code and HTTP status. Close streams and clients when finished. Clones have independent lifecycles. Retry transient failures at the application boundary and never log secrets or authentication headers.

`PAMError`

All SDKs use protocol version 1; PAM Agent configuration uses schema version 1. A client_upgrade_required response (HTTP 426) requires checking compatibility and upgrading. Unknown optional fields and notification events are tolerated; unsupported policy modes must not be applied or confirmed. Received event receipts are sent automatically and do not prove credential application. Client metadata may include server_capabilities. Missing or null means unknown; unknown names are tolerated. Capabilities describe server features, not authorization.

# Application integration overview

## Authorization, notifications and rotation

1. **Account authorization** controls which accounts the application may fetch on demand. Authorize the application before installing a client.
2. **Account credential change notifications** is an application-level switch covering all authorized accounts. Use it when applications should react to password changes; no subscription policy is required.
3. **A/B rotation** is a separately bound policy for switching between two accounts before changing the original password. Both accounts must be authorized. Open the policy’s operation guide for its cycle, waiting conditions, cancellation and recovery.

## Choose an integration

| Method | Use when | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDK | You can change the application code and let it connect to JumpServer. | Select SDK integration and your programming language. Implement a managed account-change callback for automatic updates. |
| PAM Agent | You need local credential files, business configuration updates or a local Socket, and want to keep JumpServer keys outside business code. | Select Agent integration, install the Agent and configure store, socket and services as needed. |
| Socket API | Business-managed connections through the local Agent; no JumpServer SDK or AK/SK in the business. | Socket API access; declare a service with delivery: socket. |

## Setup and acceptance

1. Create an application, authorize accounts and download its private identity configuration.
2. Choose SDK or PAM Agent, install the matching client, fetch an account and verify a real connection.
3. For automatic updates, enable application notifications and implement the business change. For A/B switching, also bind a rotation policy and enable following its current account.
4. Verify one account update or A/B switch: the application uses the new credential, old connections are released and the business result is successful. Reception, fetching and file delivery alone are insufficient.

## Where to find the details

Agent integration covers deployment, files, local APIs and business actions. SDK integration covers installation, managed callbacks and language-specific APIs. Events and commands is the shared reference for event payloads, snapshots, receipts and administrator commands. The operation guide inside each rotation policy explains its own cycle, blockers and recovery.

<!-- overview-doc:end -->


<!-- protocol-doc:start -->

# Events and commands

This reference applies to all SDK languages and PAM Agent. Prefer managed SDK callbacks or configured Agent services for normal integration; use the raw protocol only when implementing an event consumer yourself.

## Event responsibilities

| Event | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| credential.updated and snapshot items | Fetch the named account, verify its version, apply it and report the business result. Managed SDK callbacks handle the protocol. |
| app.scope.updated | Reconcile scope and remove invalid state. Removing a rotation binding does not revoke account authorization. |
| `rotation.*` (such as `rotation.started` and `rotation.completed`), `credential.change.*` (such as `credential.change.started` and `credential.change.completed`) | Update progress, logs or alerts. Do not repeat credential application or confirm business success for these notifications. |
| credential.switch.requested and app.restart.requested | Administrator commands for selected instances: claim, execute and report the command result. |

## Complete event catalog

Every Core application event, administrator command and connection control message is listed below, with compatibility entries separated. This is the complete reference; rotation details explain how the events relate to that policy workflow.

### Credential and scope events

credential.updated applies credentials. app.scope.updated and snapshot reconcile scope: detach a missing rotation policy while preserving use of authorized accounts. Only actual account authorization removal disables local access, clears retained credentials and asks the application to release connections.

| Event code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `credential.updated` | Current credentials or published account changed; fetch and apply the named account. |
| `app.scope.updated` | Account authorization, notification settings or rotation bindings changed. Use authorized_account_ids to determine account access, then snapshot to reconcile notifications and rotation following. Removing a binding must not close an otherwise authorized account connection. |

### General password-change events

General task lifecycle notifications for progress and alerts. Do not fetch again or report application success for these notifications; apply credentials on credential.updated or snapshot.

| Event code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `credential.change.started` | A password-change task is queued or running; the remote password may not have changed yet. |
| `credential.change.completed` | The password-change task succeeded; this is not proof that applications applied the credentials. |
| `credential.change.failed` | The password change failed or could not be verified; inspect the task and remote account. |

### Rotation progress events

These notifications explain cycle progress and outcomes. Application switching follows credential.updated or snapshot, not a second action on each progress event.

| Event code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rotation.verify.started` | Backup-account login verification started. |
| `rotation.verify.skipped` | Backup-account login verification skipped by credential policy. |
| `rotation.verify.failed` | Backup verification failed; no switch is published. |
| `rotation.verify.cancelled` | Backup verification was cancelled. |
| `rotation.started` | The rotation cycle has published the target account and started switching. |
| `rotation.waiting_for_app` | Waiting for required application instances to apply and confirm the target. |
| `rotation.source.waiting` | Observing successful secret fetches for the original account after publication. |
| `rotation.source.ready` | The original account no-fetch window and required client conditions allow password change. |
| `rotation.completed` | The original account password change was verified and the rotation completed. |
| `rotation.failed` | Rotation entered a password-change failure or recovery-required state. |
| `rotation.force_stopped` | An administrator ended the cycle without waiting for remaining recovery confirmations. |

### Administrator command events

Claim with running, execute only when accepted is true, then report the command result. These are independent of automatic rotation progress.

| Event code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `credential.switch.requested` | Apply the already published account and version on selected instances; this does not start a rotation. |
| `app.restart.requested` | Execute the supported application restart action and verify health. |

### Connection and receipt messages

SDK and Agent manage liveness and receipts. snapshot and pong need no received receipt; snapshot credential items are applied separately.

| Event code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `snapshot` | Core sends the current notification scope and authorized account IDs on connection, reconnection or scope changes. |
| `ping` | The client sends an application-level keepalive to Core. |
| `pong` | Core replies to an application-level ping. |
| `received` | The client acknowledges reading an event; it does not report business success. |

### Compatibility events

Legacy event names and old preparation-cycle entries, not a workflow for new integrations. Current Core no longer emits credential.revoked; new rotation cycles verify the backup before publishing the switch.

| Event code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `credential.revoked` | Retired: current Core no longer sends this event. Use app.scope.updated and snapshot; retained only for older Core integrations and historical records. |
| `configuration.updated` | Legacy event name, normalized to `app.scope.updated`. |
| `rotation.preparation.started` | Legacy preparation began aligning applications to the current account. |
| `rotation.accounts.aligned` | Applications finished alignment in the legacy preparation flow. |
| `rotation.standby.waiting` | Legacy preparation is observing secret fetches for the standby account. |
| `rotation.preparation.ready` | Legacy preparation is ready; no switch or password change is implied. |
| `rotation.preparation.cancelled` | Legacy preparation was cancelled. |
| `rotation.verification.started` | Legacy event name, normalized to `rotation.verify.started`. |
| `rotation.verification.failed` | Legacy event name, normalized to `rotation.verify.failed`. |
| `rotation.verification.cancelled` | Legacy event name, normalized to `rotation.verify.cancelled`. |
| `application.scope.updated` | Legacy event name, normalized to `app.scope.updated`. |
| `application.restart.requested` | Legacy event name, normalized to `app.restart.requested`. |
| `rotation.waiting_for_application` | Legacy event name, normalized to `rotation.waiting_for_app`. |
| `rotation.verification.skipped` | Legacy event name, normalized to `rotation.verify.skipped`. |

## Payload fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| event_id | Event identity for receipts and application results. snapshot itself has no receipt; credential items can have their own event_id. |
| event / occurred_at | Event type and publication time. |
| account_id / account_revision | Concrete target account and password version. A fresh account revision must match before application. |
| credential_key / revision | Policy publication metadata for A/B rotation. Ordinary account notifications use account revisions. Do not mix the two version domains. |
| credential_mode | alternating_rotation for an A/B policy; subscription for application-level account notifications, without a subscription policy. Application-wide events may use null. |
| account_switch.account_ids | Accounts associated with an A/B switch. |
| operation_id | Correlates events belonging to one change operation or rotation cycle. |
| command_id / expires_at | Administrator command identity and execution deadline. Commands have a separate result API. |

## Snapshots and authorization

Core sends snapshot on connection, reconnection and scope changes. Its credentials include all authorized accounts when application notifications are enabled, plus active authorized A/B rotation policies bound to the application. Process each item like credential.updated using event_id, account_id and account_revision. The snapshot also includes authorized_account_ids; get_accounts lists authorized account metadata. Removing a rotation policy binding does not revoke account authorization.

```json
{
  "event": "snapshot",
  "authorized_account_ids": ["<account-id>"],
  "credentials": [{
    "event_id": "<event-id>", "key": "account:<account-id>",
    "credential_mode": "subscription", "account_id": "<account-id>",
    "revision": 1, "account_revision": 1
  }]
}
```

## Receipts and business results

The SDK automatically sends a best-effort received receipt before yielding a business event. No additional receipt is required from the application. A receipt means only that the event was read, not that credentials were applied; it does not replace confirmation. Reconcile the initial and reconnect snapshots; snapshot and pong require no receipt.

```json
{"event": "received", "event_id": "<event-id>"}
```

Fetch the target account with `account_id`. Apply and verify the application change, then report `success` or `failed` using `event_id`. A delivery receipt or successful fetch does not mean the application succeeded. Events and reconnect snapshot items include `event_id`, `account_id` and `account_revision`. Verify the account version before applying it. Restart and manual switch commands must first be claimed with `running`. Make application handlers idempotent; a reconnect may repeat an event.

## Administrator commands

Administrators send commands from the application’s Send event action and choose instances and an expiry time.

- credential.switch.requested asks the instance to apply the rotation policy’s **already published** account and version. It does not start a rotation or select another account.
- app.restart.requested asks the application to run its supported restart action and verify health. The SDK application must implement that handler; Agent support depends on its local service configuration.

Managed SDK handlers claim and report commands automatically. Raw consumers use the signed client API:

1. GET /api/v1/accounts/credential-client/commands/ with instance_id to poll pending commands; connected instances can also receive them over WebSocket.
2. POST /api/v1/accounts/credential-client/command-result/ with instance_id, command_id and status: running. Execute only if accepted is true.
3. After actual application switching or a successful restart health check, report status: success through the same command-result API; on failure report failed with a safe error_code. A received receipt or confirm_event alone does not replace command-result reporting.

Expired commands cannot be claimed. Duplicate delivery must not repeat a claimed action. Failed command actions are not automatically repeated; inspect the application before sending a new restart request.

## Connection liveness and compatibility

Event connections send application ping messages at 10-second intervals while idle and reconnect after approximately 30 seconds without messages. Reconnect uses 1–30 second exponential backoff and fresh signatures. Reconnect snapshots restore current state; past events are not replayed.

Current names are app.scope.updated, app.restart.requested, rotation.verify.started/failed/cancelled and rotation.waiting_for_app. Old application prefixes, rotation.verification names and configuration.updated normalize to the new names without changing event IDs. credential.revoked is no longer emitted and remains only for older Core integrations and historical records.

`get_credential` and key-based confirmation remain available for older integrations. New integrations use `get_account` and `confirm_event`. The event-result workflow requires the corresponding Core update; SDK 1.0.2 alone cannot add this server capability.

<!-- protocol-doc:end -->


<!-- socket-doc:start -->
# Socket API access

Use a local PAM Agent from any application without installing a JumpServer SDK or storing application AK/SK in the business process. The Agent handles Core authentication, authorization, credential refresh, A/B resolution and result retries. The application owns real connections and business validation.

## 1. Unix Socket / HTTP / WebSocket

The transport is a Unix Domain Socket (AF_UNIX), not TCP. Connect to its filesystem path; no IP address or port is opened. HTTP/JSON requests and the WebSocket event channel share this socket. The localhost URL supplies the HTTP Host only. Agent-to-Core traffic still uses HTTPS/WSS.

## 2. Agent / services

Add a socket service to the Agent configuration. Use the same account declarations and allow_account_switch rules as file delivery. The declared A ID remains the map key while account_id identifies the active A/B account. Socket services cannot also configure update_config, reload_service, credential_check or app_check. restart_supported is an explicit opt-in for business restart commands.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "endpoint": "https://jumpserver.example.com",
  "app_id": "<application-id>",
  "app_secret": "<application-secret>",
  "org_id": "<org-id>",
  "pull_interval": 300,
  "socket": {
    "path": "/run/jms-pam-agent/agent.sock",
    "owner": "appuser"
  },
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "orders",
      "delivery": "socket",
      "allow_account_switch": true,
      "restart_supported": false,
      "accounts": [
        {
          "id": "<primary-account-id>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Events / A/B

Connect, read the initial snapshot, retrieve the delivery credentials, verify new real connections, replace business connections and release old sessions, then submit success. Receiving a notification or fetching a password never proves that the business has switched. A failed callback submits failed and is retried after the Agent backoff.

Every connection starts with the latest snapshot; this is current-state reconciliation, not historical replay. delivery contains metadata only, including delivery_id, declared-account keys and exact account/policy revisions. Revocations are delivered even during a Core outage; revoked_account_ids requires closing old sessions. With no complete credentials, a delivery may be absent while refresh is pending. Each independently applied business instance needs its own service_id. Only one WebSocket connection per service is accepted.

```text
GET /v1/events?service_id=orders
Upgrade: websocket
```

```json
{
  "event": "snapshot",

```

```json
{"request_id":"3","operation":"result","delivery_id":"<delivery-id>","status":"failed","error_code":"database_probe_failed"}
```

Return the exact delivery_id with success or failed. The Agent persists accepted results before reporting to Core and waits for every relevant service before confirming a credential event. accepted means locally saved, not that Core has already accepted it. Duplicate successful results are idempotent; a superseded version returns HTTP 409. After failed, retry_ready becomes true after 1–30 seconds. If a result response is lost, retry the result rather than repeating successful business work. Callbacks must be idempotent: a crash between a business effect and its local ACK cannot guarantee exactly-once execution. Snapshot fields received, credentials_read and result track distinct local stages. core_status separately tracks pending, confirmed, failed or not_required. Send the received operation to record a receipt; credential retrieval also records receipt. Neither operation confirms business success.

## 4. Commands / status

Commands are claimed by the Agent before delegation. Restart commands appear in commands only for services with restart_supported=true. Report command.result after restart and readiness validation; success or failure is persisted and Core reporting is retried without executing the command again. A/B switch commands reuse credential delivery and its business result. Expired commands cannot be acknowledged.

```json
{"request_id":"4","operation":"command.result","command_id":"<command-id>","status":"success"}
```

Business status is separate from credential confirmation. Use starting, running, degraded, stopping, stopped or error and a short non-secret error_code. Account usage is updated only after business success, and the Agent aggregates all service reports. GET /v1/usage returns the aggregate. The existing POST /v1/usage replaces the instance-wide explicit account declaration; it does not acknowledge events.

```json
{"request_id":"5","operation":"status","status":"degraded","error_code":"database_unavailable"}
```

## 5. API

| HTTP | API |
| --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/health`, `/v1/services` |
| GET | `/v1/accounts`, `/v1/usage` |
| GET | `/v1/credential?account_id=<id>&allow_local_fallback=false` |
| GET | `/v1/application`, `/v1/instance`, `/v1/policies?search=...` |
| GET | `/v1/policy?key=<key>` or `/v1/policy?policy_id=<id>` |
| GET | `/v1/services/<service_id>` |
| GET | `/v1/services/<service_id>/credentials?delivery_id=<delivery_id>` |
| POST | `/v1/services/<service_id>/received`, `/v1/services/<service_id>/results` |
| POST | `/v1/services/<service_id>/status` |
| POST | `/v1/services/<service_id>/commands/<command_id>/result` |
| POST | `/v1/usage`, `/v1/confirm` |

WebSocket operations: `ping`, `received`, `accounts`, `credential`, `application`, `instance`, `policies`, `policy`, `credentials`, `result`, `command.result`, `status`, `usage`.
`usage` without `account_ids` reads the aggregate; with `account_ids` (including `[]`) it replaces the instance-wide explicit usage declaration, just like HTTP POST `/v1/usage`.
Every request includes `request_id`; responses contain the same ID and `result` or `error: {code, status}`. Snapshots can arrive between responses. `{"event":"ping"}` is a heartbeat. HTTP result/status bodies use the same fields without `request_id` and `operation`.

```bash
curl --fail --unix-socket /run/jms-pam-agent/agent.sock \
  http://localhost/v1/services/orders
```

Unix socket ownership is the access boundary. service_id identifies a business consumer, not a separate security identity: processes able to open the same socket share the application authorization. Keep unrelated trust domains on separate Agent instances/sockets. Events omit passwords; retrieve credentials explicitly and never log them. Polling the service snapshot and posting results is supported when a language has no Unix-socket WebSocket client.

## 6. Python

The Python example uses websockets, not a JumpServer SDK. By default it only observes metadata and never acknowledges business success. Implement the Business callbacks and call run(socket_path, service_id, business) for real processing. On a new business process, initialize connections from the current delivery even when it was applied by the previous process. Persist business-side delivery IDs when crash-safe de-duplication is required.

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'websockets>=11'
curl -fL https://jumpserver.example.com/api/v1/accounts/client-source/socket/ -o jms-pam-clients.tar.gz &&
tar -xzf jms-pam-clients.tar.gz
cd ./jms-pam-clients/socket
python3 python_example.py --socket /run/jms-pam-agent/agent.sock --service orders
```

```python
"""Unix Socket WebSocket example, without a JumpServer SDK or application keys.

Observe: python python_example.py --socket /run/jms-pam-agent/agent.sock --service orders
For business processing, subclass Business and call run(socket, service, business).
