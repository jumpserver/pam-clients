# JumpServer PAM Java SDK

Implement the account-change callback below, then start the managed listener. The SDK handles snapshots, fresh account lookup, account/version validation, retry, command claims and event results. Return only after validating the real connection, switching the application pool and releasing old connections. Python and Node.js use subclass hooks, Go uses OnAccountChanged, and Java uses AccountEventListener. The placeholder fails until business switching is implemented.

## Requirements

- JDK 11+ / Maven / Jackson

## Configure and run

Install the SDK and use the configuration below. Authorize accounts for pull in Application Management; bind policies only when push or rotation is needed. Obtain the application AK/SK and organization ID from its access materials. Replace placeholders and keep identity material in deployment secrets. Use a stable, unique instance ID for each replica. Fetch by account ID.

```bash
export JMS_ENDPOINT='https://jumpserver.example.com'
export JMS_APP_ID='<app-id>'
export JMS_APP_SECRET='<app-secret>'
export JMS_ORG_ID='<org-id>'
export JMS_INSTANCE_ID='app-node-1'
export JMS_ACCOUNT_ID='<account-id>'

```

Go is distributed with versioned module tags. Java and Node.js are available as SDK source archives in Release 1.0.2; Maven and Node.js are required to install them. Run the following installation commands from your application directory. Add the Java dependency to pom.xml. The examples below use the installed package imports.

```bash
curl -fLO https://github.com/jumpserver/pam-clients/releases/download/v1.0.2/jms-pam-java.tar.gz
tar -xzf jms-pam-java.tar.gz
mvn -f ./java/pom.xml install
```

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.jumpserver</groupId>
  <artifactId>jms-pam</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

```java
import org.jumpserver.pam.Client;
```

## Request and response

```java
package org.jumpserver.pam;

public final class Demo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Client.Options options =
        new Client.Options(
                System.getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"),
                System.getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
                System.getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"),
                System.getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"))
            .orgId(System.getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"));
    try (Client client = new Client(options)) {
      Models.Account account =
          client.getAccount(System.getenv("JMS_ACCOUNT_ID"));
      // Pass account.getUsername() / getSecret() to the connection pool.
      System.out.println(
          "Fetched revision "
              + account.getRevision()
              + "; implement application credential switching.");
    }
  }
}
```

### List authorized accounts

Use the account listing methods to discover the application’s current authorized pull scope. Listings return account and asset metadata plus related push policies, without retrieving passwords or recording credential fetches. Accounts without policies are included. The full-list method follows all pages; the page method returns `count` and `accounts` (Go returns the slice and total separately). Defaults are limit 200 and offset 0; limit is 1–500 and search is at most 128 characters, matching account name, username, asset name or address. Duplicate accounts, incomplete results and changing totals raise an error; retry the whole listing if authorization changes. Use an account ID with the account-fetch method when its secret is needed. Examples require SDK source containing these new methods; published version 1.0.2 does not yet provide them in Python, Java or Node.js.

```java
package org.jumpserver.pam;

public final class AccountsDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Client.Options options =
        new Client.Options(
                System.getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"), System.getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
                System.getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"), System.getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"))
            .orgId(System.getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"));
    try (Client client = new Client(options)) {
      for (Models.AuthorizedAccount account : client.listAccounts()) {
        System.out.println(
            account.getId() + " " + account.getUsername() + " " + account.getAsset().getName());
      }
      Models.AccountsPage page = client.listAccountsPage(20, 0, "database");
      System.out.println("Matching accounts: " + page.getCount());
      // Use an authorized account.getId() with getAccount when its secret is needed.
    }
  }
}
```


### Application, replica and policy information

Read the authenticated application ID, name, organization and authorized account/policy counts with getApplication; getClientInfo returns only the current replica’s registration, type and versions. Policy listing returns the entire visible bound list, including disabled policies; search matches policy names or keys. Fetch a policy using exactly one of its ID or base policy key, rather than an account push key. Rotation policies require authorization for both accounts and the active account. Subscription counts include only accounts currently authorized to this application. These calls return metadata without secrets and do not fetch credentials or confirm application changes. As with account queries, the replica is registered on first access. They require updated Core and SDK source; the published 1.0.2 does not yet contain these methods.

```java
package org.jumpserver.pam;

import java.util.List;

public final class ApplicationInfoDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Client.Options options =
        new Client.Options(
                System.getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"), System.getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
                System.getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"), System.getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID"))
            .orgId(System.getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"));
    try (Client client = new Client(options)) {
      Models.ApplicationInfo application = client.getApplication();
      System.out.println(
          application.getId() + " " + application.getName() + " " + application.getAccountsCount());
      Models.ClientInfo replica = client.getClientInfo();
      System.out.println(replica.getInstanceId() + " " + replica.getClientVersion());
      List<Models.CredentialPolicy> policies = client.listPolicies();
      for (Models.CredentialPolicy policy : policies) {
        System.out.println(
            policy.getKey()
                + " "
                + policy.getName()
                + " "
                + policy.isActive()
                + " "
                + policy.getStatus());
      }
      if (!policies.isEmpty()) {
        Models.CredentialPolicy policy = client.getPolicyById(policies.get(0).getId());
        System.out.println(policy.getName() + " " + policy.getAccountsCount());
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Events and credential application

Fetch the target account with `account_id`. Apply and verify the application change, then report `success` or `failed` using `event_id`. A delivery receipt or successful fetch does not mean the application succeeded. Events and reconnect snapshot items include `event_id`, `account_id` and `account_revision`. Verify the account version before applying it. Restart and manual switch commands must first be claimed with `running`. Make application handlers idempotent; a reconnect may repeat an event.

```java
package org.jumpserver.pam;

import org.jumpserver.pam.Models.Account;

public final class EventsDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Client.Options options = new Client.Options(System.getenv("JMS_ENDPOINT"), System.getenv("JMS_APP_ID"),
        System.getenv("JMS_APP_SECRET"), System.getenv("JMS_INSTANCE_ID")).orgId(System.getenv("JMS_ORG_ID"));
    try (Client client = new Client(options)) {
      Thread stop = new Thread(client::close, "jms-pam-shutdown");
      Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(stop);
      try {
        // SDK handles snapshots, fresh fetches, versions, retries and event results.
        // Pull-only code can use client.reportAccounts(List.of(accountId)); List.of() clears usage.
        client.watchEvents(new AccountEventListener() {
          public void onAccountChanged(Account account) {
            // Validate, switch the pool and release old connections before returning.
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Implement application account switching");
          }
          public void onAccountRevoked(String accountId) {
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Implement revoked account cleanup");
          }
        });
      } catch (InterruptedException error) {
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
      } finally { Runtime.getRuntime().removeShutdownHook(stop); }
    }
  }
}
```

`get_credential` and key-based confirmation remain available for older integrations. New integrations use `get_account` and `confirm_event`. The event-result workflow requires the corresponding Core update; SDK 1.0.2 alone cannot add this server capability.

## Application commands

Fetch the target account with `account_id`. Apply and verify the application change, then report `success` or `failed` using `event_id`. A delivery receipt or successful fetch does not mean the application succeeded. Events and reconnect snapshot items include `event_id`, `account_id` and `account_revision`. Verify the account version before applying it. Restart and manual switch commands must first be claimed with `running`. Make application handlers idempotent; a reconnect may repeat an event.

## Common methods

- `getApplication() / getClientInfo()`
- `reportAccounts(accountIds) / reportStatus(status, accountId) / reportStatus(ApplicationStatus) / reportStatusStrict(report)`
- `listPolicies() / listPolicies(search) / getPolicy(key) / getPolicyById(policyId)`
- `listAccounts() / listAccounts(search)`
- `listAccountsPage(limit, offset, search)`
- `getAccount(accountId)`
- `getAccount(accountId, false)`
- `confirmEvent(eventId, status, errorCode)`
- `watchCredentialEvents()`
- `watchEvents(listener) / startEvents(listener)`
- `EventSubscription.stop() / close() / awaitTermination()`
- `listApplicationCommands()`
- `reportApplicationCommandResult(commandId, status, errorCode)`
- `executeApplicationCommand(event, handler)`
- `syncAgent(credentials, deliveredCredentials, configDigest, syncStatus, syncError)`
- `clone() / close()`

### Application status reporting

Report a complete snapshot of the application state and the account IDs currently in use. States: `starting`, `running`, `degraded`, `stopping`, `stopped`, `error`. An empty account list clears previous usage. Call on state changes or from your own heartbeat; no background reporting is started. Python, Java and Node.js return false on network/API failures, including an older Core without this endpoint; Go provides `TryReportStatus` for the same behavior. Strict variants expose failure details. Invalid arguments are rejected. Requests use the configured HTTP timeout; keep reporting off latency-sensitive paths. Reporting never fetches secrets, confirms rotation or invalidates retained credentials. Use machine-readable `error_code` only, without secrets or exception messages. `get_client_info` / `GetClientInfo` / `getClientInfo` return the last reported snapshot and its timestamp.

```java
boolean accepted = client.reportAccounts(java.util.List.of(account.getId()));
client.reportAccounts(java.util.Collections.emptyList());
```


## Troubleshooting

HTTP, network, authentication and response decoding failures use the SDK exception/error type with code and HTTP status. Close streams and clients when finished. Clones have independent lifecycles. Retry transient failures at the application boundary and never log secrets or authentication headers.

`PAMException`

All SDKs use protocol version 1; Agent configuration uses schema version 1. A client_upgrade_required response (HTTP 426) requires checking compatibility and upgrading. Unknown optional fields and notification events are tolerated; unsupported policy modes must not be applied or confirmed. Received event receipts are sent automatically and do not prove credential application. Client metadata may include server_capabilities. Missing or null means unknown; unknown names are tolerated. Capabilities describe server features, not authorization.

## Go Agent integration

Agent identity uses app_id, app_secret, org_id and a stable instance_id. Application authorization controls pull; policy bindings control push. All file paths and service actions are local: state_file retains the latest passwords, event_file appends metadata without secrets, delivery selects default output, and rules configure files, templates and reload/restart or fixed scripts. On an update notification the Agent fetches the current password, persists it, atomically replaces output files, then runs the configured action. Failed delivery is retried. Use credentials[].key from get_accounts in rules; subscription push keys are account:<account-id>, independent of the selecting policy. Empty rules write one file per key by default.

Local rules configure target files, JSON/EnvironmentFile rendering or trusted templates, and an optional systemd reload/restart or fixed executable. Scripts receive credential JSON on stdin, use fixed arguments, have a bounded timeout and must validate their application before returning success. Core cannot add script paths or expand local capabilities. Restart the Agent after editing its private configuration.

The downloaded bootstrap contains Agent identity and delivery settings. Edit rules to declare the account IDs used by the business, update its configuration, activate the change and verify the running connection. An account selector with allow_account_switch also follows A/B rotation in either direction. Optional credential_check validates the new login before file changes. The Agent supplies default state, event and socket paths and a 300-second reconciliation interval. Empty rules write one default file per delivered credential.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://jumpserver.example.com",
  "app_id": "<application-id>",
  "app_secret": "<application-secret>",
  "org_id": "<org-id>",
  "instance_id": "orders-node-1",
  "delivery": {
    "delivery_mode": "json",
    "delivery_root": "/opt/jumpserver-pam/credentials",
    "app_user": "orders"
  },
  "rules": []
}
```

`rules`:

```json
[
  {
    "accounts": [
      {
        "account_id": "<primary-account-id>",
        "allow_account_switch": true
      }
    ],
    "config_update": {
      "file": "/etc/order-service/config.yml",
      "format": "auto",
      "fields_map": {
        "DB_USER": "username",
        "DB_PASSWORD": "secret"
      }
    },
    "service_action": {
      "unit": "order-service.service",
      "operation": "restart"
    },
    "application_check": {
      "path": "/usr/local/libexec/jms-pam/check-running-db",
      "confirm_on_success": true
    }
  }
]
```

`config_update.format` defaults to `auto`; omitting it has the same effect. Detection uses the file extension: `.txt`, `.env` and `.properties` use `env` (`KEY=value`); `.yml` and `.yaml` use `yaml` (top-level `KEY: value`, written as quoted strings). For other extensions, explicitly choose `env` or `yaml`. Mapped fields must already exist exactly once; unrelated settings are preserved. INI sections and nested YAML require `files` + `template_file` to generate the whole file, or a custom `script`. Environment-file updates take effect after the application rereads the file or restarts.

```bash
jms-pam-agent get_accounts
jms-pam-agent get_secret '<account-id>'
sudo jms-pam-agent check-config
sudo systemctl restart jms-pam-agent
```
